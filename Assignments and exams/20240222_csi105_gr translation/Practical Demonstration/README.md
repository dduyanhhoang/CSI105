Compiled languages like C are often used for system-level programming, applications where performance is critical, and situations where direct hardware manipulation is required. Compilation allows for extensive code analysis and optimization by the compiler, potentially resulting in faster and more efficient executables. 

Interpreted languages like Python excel in web development, data analysis, scripting, and rapid prototyping, where development speed and portability are more important than raw execution speed. Interpretation focuses on flexibility and ease of use, with performance optimizations typically happening at a higher level or relying on just-in-time compilation techniques.

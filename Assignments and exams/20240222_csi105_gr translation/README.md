- Abstract: A brief summary of the report's content, focusing on the objective, methodology, and key findings.
- Introduction
    - Background information on programming language translation.
    - Importance and relevance of studying programming language translation.
    - Objectives of the report.
- Methodology (4 Steps of Programming Language Translation)
    - Lexical Analysis: Breaking down the code into tokens.
    - Syntax Analysis: Structuring tokens into a parse tree based on grammar rules.
    - Semantic Analysis: Ensuring the parse tree's operations are logically correct and feasible.
    - Code Generation: Translating the validated tree into machine code.
- Practical Demonstration
    - Section Name: "Translation in Action: C and Python"
        - Subsection for C:
            - Brief introduction to C compilation process.
            - Step-by-step demonstration using a simple "Hello, World!" program.
        - Subsection for Python:
            - Explanation of Python's interpretation process.
            - Demonstration of lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis phases, and bytecode execution using the same "Hello, World!" example.
- Comparative Analysis
    - Discuss the differences between compilation (C) and interpretation (Python) in the context of the translation process.
    - Highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach.
- Conclusion
    - Summarize the key points made in the report.
    - Reflect on the learning outcomes of the practical demonstrations.
